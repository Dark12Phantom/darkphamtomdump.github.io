                    <h1>Introduction</h1>
                    <p>Transferring data over a transmission medium between two or more devices, systems, or places is
                        known as data
                        communication. Nowadays, computing and telecommunications depend heavily on this data
                        transmission, which makes a
                        variety of applications conceivable, including email, video chatting, the Internet, and many
                        more things.</p>
                    <p>Data communication specifically refers to the process of using computing and communication
                        technologies to transfer data
                        (the message) from a sender to a receiver — or even back and forth between participating
                        parties.</p>
                    <p>Modern data networks all provide the same basic functions of transferring data from sender to
                        receiver, but each network
                        can use different network hardware and software to achieve these ends. Communication between
                        devices adheres to
                        industrial communications protocols, which is the set of rules that define how data is
                        exchanged.</p>
